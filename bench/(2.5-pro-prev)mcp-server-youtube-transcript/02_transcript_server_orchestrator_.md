# Chapter 2: Transcript Server Orchestrator

In the [previous chapter](01_tool_capability_definition_.md), we learned how our server describes its abilities using a "Tool Capability Definition". It's like creating a menu (`get_transcript`) so others know what services we offer and what information they need to provide (`url`, `lang`).

But who *runs* the shop? Who listens for customer orders (requests), understands them, and makes sure the right work gets done? That's where the **Transcript Server Orchestrator** comes in!

## The Shop Manager: `TranscriptServer`

Think of our entire `mcp-server-youtube-transcript` program as a small, specialized shop that only does one thing: fetching YouTube transcripts. The `TranscriptServer` class is the *manager* of this shop.

What does a manager do?

1.  **Opens the Shop:** Starts everything up so it's ready for business.
2.  **Listens for Customers:** Waits for someone (another program or AI) to make a request.
3.  **Understands Requests:** Figures out what the customer wants ("List your services" or "Get me this transcript").
4.  **Delegates the Work:** Asks the specialist employee to do the actual job (like getting the transcript).
5.  **Gives the Result:** Hands the finished product (the transcript) back to the customer.

Our `TranscriptServer` class does exactly these things, but in terms of software:

1.  **Starts the Server:** Initializes the communication system (using the [MCP Server Framework](03_mcp_server_framework_.md)) so it can receive requests.
2.  **Listens for Requests:** Waits for incoming messages based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
3.  **Handles Requests:** Examines the request type. Is it asking for a list of tools? Or is it asking to *use* the `get_transcript` tool? We'll look closer at this in [MCP Request Handling](04_mcp_request_handling_.md).
4.  **Delegates to the Extractor:** If the request is to get a transcript, it tells the `YouTubeTranscriptExtractor` (our specialist) to go fetch it. The details of the extractor are covered in [Transcript Extraction Logic](05_transcript_extraction_logic_.md).
5.  **Sends the Response:** Packages the result (the list of tools or the actual transcript) and sends it back.

## The `TranscriptServer` Class Structure

Let's peek at the basic structure of our manager, the `TranscriptServer` class, in the code (`src/index.ts`). Don't worry about every detail yet!

```typescript
// src/index.ts (Simplified)

import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js";
// ... other imports

// The specialist worker class (details in later chapters)
class YouTubeTranscriptExtractor { /* ... */ }

// Our main orchestrator class
class TranscriptServer {
  private extractor: YouTubeTranscriptExtractor; // The specialist worker
  private server: Server; // The communication system object

  constructor() {
    // Create the specialist when the manager starts
    this.extractor = new YouTubeTranscriptExtractor();
    // Create the communication system object
    this.server = new Server(/* ... configuration ... */);

    // Tell the system HOW to handle different requests
    this.setupHandlers();
    // Set up basic error handling
    this.setupErrorHandling();
  }

  // ... methods to set up request handlers ...
  private setupHandlers(): void { /* ... see later ... */ }
  private setupErrorHandling(): void { /* ... */ }

  // Method to "open the shop"
  async start(): Promise<void> { /* ... */ }

  // Method to "close the shop"
  async stop(): Promise<void> { /* ... */ }

  // Method that decides what to do for a 'call tool' request
  private async handleToolCall(name: string, args: any): Promise<any> {
    /* ... see later ... */
  }
}
```

*   **`extractor: YouTubeTranscriptExtractor;`**: The manager keeps a reference to its specialist worker.
*   **`server: Server;`**: This represents the underlying communication framework provided by the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. It handles the low-level sending and receiving of messages.
*   **`constructor()`**: This is like the manager's morning routine. When the `TranscriptServer` is created, it immediately creates its `extractor` helper and sets up the main `server` communication object. It also calls `setupHandlers()` to teach the `server` object what to do for different kinds of incoming messages.
*   **`start()`**: This method actually starts the communication server, making it ready to listen for requests. Think of it as flipping the "Open" sign on the shop door.
*   **`handleToolCall()`**: This specific method is responsible for dealing with requests that want to *use* one of the tools (like `get_transcript`).

## How it Handles a Transcript Request (Simplified)

Let's imagine a customer (an AI Assistant) wants a transcript for the video `dQw4w9WgXcQ` in English (`en`).

1.  The AI Assistant sends a "Call Tool" request: `name: "get_transcript"`, `arguments: { url: "dQw4w9WgXcQ", lang: "en" }`.
2.  The underlying MCP framework receives this request and gives it to our `TranscriptServer` because we set it up to handle these kinds of requests in `setupHandlers()`.
3.  The `TranscriptServer`'s `handleToolCall` method is triggered.
4.  Inside `handleToolCall`, it sees the `name` is `"get_transcript"`.
5.  It takes the `url` and `lang` from the arguments.
6.  It asks its specialist worker (`this.extractor`) to do the job: `this.extractor.getTranscript("dQw4w9WgXcQ", "en")`. (Note: It also uses the extractor to get the clean video ID first, see [Video ID Extraction](06_video_id_extraction_.md)).
7.  The `extractor` does its magic (fetches the transcript).
8.  The `extractor` gives the raw transcript text back to the `TranscriptServer`.
9.  The `TranscriptServer` packages this text into the correct response format.
10. The underlying MCP framework sends this response back to the AI Assistant.

Here's a diagram showing this flow:

    Extractor-->>TranscriptServer: Returns transcript text "Never gonna give..."
    Note right of TranscriptServer: Packages result
    TranscriptServer-->>AI_Assistant: ToolResult: { content: "Never gonna give..." }
```

## Looking Inside `handleToolCall`

Let's look at a simplified version of the code within `handleToolCall` that performs steps 4-9 above:

```typescript
// Inside the TranscriptServer class (src/index.ts) - Simplified

private async handleToolCall(name: string, args: any): Promise<{ toolResult: CallToolResult }> {
  switch (name) {
    case "get_transcript": { // Is the request for our transcript tool?
      // Get the URL and language from the arguments
      const { url: input, lang = "en" } = args;

      // --- Input Validation (Simplified) ---
      // (Make sure 'input' and 'lang' are provided and are strings)
      // (Details in Error Handling & Process Management)

      try {
        // --- Step 6a: Ask extractor to get clean Video ID ---
        const videoId = this.extractor.extractYoutubeId(input);
        console.error(`Processing transcript for video: ${videoId}`);

        // --- Step 6b: Ask extractor to fetch the transcript ---
        const transcript = await this.extractor.getTranscript(videoId, lang);
        console.error(`Successfully extracted transcript...`);

        // --- Steps 8 & 9: Prepare the successful result ---
        return {
          toolResult: {
            content: [{ type: "text", text: transcript }], // The actual transcript
            isError: false // Indicate success
            // ... metadata added here ...
          }
        };
      } catch (error) {
        // --- Handle potential errors (Chapter 7) ---
        console.error('Transcript extraction failed:', error);
        // Convert error to standard MCP error format and throw it
        throw new McpError(/* ... error details ... */);
      }
    }

    default:
      // If the tool name isn't "get_transcript", we don't know it
      throw new McpError(ErrorCode.MethodNotFound, `Unknown tool: ${name}`);
  }
}
```

This code shows the core logic: it checks the tool name, gets the arguments, uses the `this.extractor` to perform the core tasks ([Video ID Extraction](06_video_id_extraction_.md) and [Transcript Extraction Logic](05_transcript_extraction_logic_.md)), and then prepares the result. It also includes basic error handling (covered more in [Error Handling & Process Management](07_error_handling___process_management_.md)).

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we met the **Transcript Server Orchestrator** â€“ the `TranscriptServer` class. It acts as the central manager for our transcript-fetching service.

We learned that its main jobs are:

*   Setting up and starting the server.
*   Listening for incoming requests using a communication protocol (MCP).
*   Understanding what kind of request it received (e.g., "list tools" or "call a tool").
*   Delegating the actual transcript fetching work to a specialist component (`YouTubeTranscriptExtractor`).
*   Packaging and sending the final response back.

The `TranscriptServer` doesn't fetch transcripts itself; it *orchestrates* the process, bringing together the communication framework and the specialized extraction logic.

Now that we understand the role of the orchestrator, let's dive deeper into the communication system it uses.
