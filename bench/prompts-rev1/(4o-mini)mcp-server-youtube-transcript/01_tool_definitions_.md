# Chapter 1: Tool Definitions


In this chapter, we will explore the concept of Tool Definitions in the context of the `mcp-server-youtube-transcript` project. Think of Tool Definitions as a menu in a restaurant: it lists the dishes that can be served (or in our case, the tools that the server can handle), along with information about each dish (tool) and the ingredients needed to create it (input requirements).

## Understanding Tool Definitions

Tool Definitions provide a structured way to define functionalities that the server can perform. Each tool has three key components:

1. **Name**: A unique identifier for the tool.
2. **Description**: A brief explanation of what the tool does.
3. **Input Requirements**: Specifications of what data (or parameters) the tool needs to operate effectively.

For instance, in our project, we have a tool named `get_transcript` that extracts transcripts from YouTube videos.

Here's how a Tool Definition is structured in our code:

```typescript
const TOOLS: Tool[] = [
  {
    name: "get_transcript", // The name of the tool
    description: "Extract transcript from a YouTube video URL or ID", // What the tool does
    inputSchema: { // Requirements for inputs
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        url: {
          type: "string",
          description: "YouTube video URL or ID" // URL or ID of the video
        },
        lang: {
          type: "string",
          description: "Language code for transcript (e.g., 'ko', 'en')", // Language for the transcript
          default: "en" // Default language if not specified
        }
      },
      required: ["url", "lang"] // Required fields
    }
  }
];
```

### Components Explained

1. **Name**: Each tool needs a name that uniquely identifies it within our server.
2. **Description**: It's essential to have a user-friendly description so that anyone reading the tool definition understands its purpose.
3. **Input Schema**: This section is crucial. It outlines:
   - The data types (e.g., string, object) required as inputs.
   - Any default values.
   - Which fields are mandatory (in our case, both `url` and `lang` are required).

### Using Tool Definitions

Tool Definitions serve as a guide for what inputs are needed when calling a tool from the server. When a user wishes to use the `get_transcript` tool, they need to provide both the URL or ID of the YouTube video and the language code for the transcript they desire.

This organization makes it easy for developers to understand how to interact with the server and what to expect when invoking any of the defined tools.

### Summary

In summary, Tool Definitions form the foundational blueprint for the tools available on our server, ensuring clarity and ease of use. They encapsulate the essential details about each tool â€“ what it does and what it needs to function.

As we continue to develop the server, understanding these definitions will guide how we implement and manage different functionalities.

Next, we'll dive deeper into how the `YouTubeTranscriptExtractor` tool works in the context of our server. You can find this in the next chapter: [YouTubeTranscriptExtractor](02_youtubetranscriptextractor_.md).
