This is a tutorial project of [Pocket Flow](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow), a 100-line LLM framework. It crawls GitHub repositories and build a knowledge base from the code. It analyzes entire codebases to identify core abstractions and how they interact, and transforms complex code into beginner-friendly tutorials with clear visualizations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Clone this repository

2. Configure your environment variables in the `.env` file:
   ```bash
   # Copy the sample .env file
   cp .env.sample .env
   
   # Edit the .env file with your credentials
   # GEMINI_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   # GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token
   ```

3. Run the application using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Access the Streamlit web interface at http://localhost:8501

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository

2. Install dependencies: 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up LLM in [`utils/call_llm.py`](./utils/call_llm.py) by providing credentials (API key or project name). We highly recommend the latest models with thinking capabilities (Gemini Pro 2.5, Claude 3.7 with thinking, O1). You can verify if it is correctly set up by running:
   ```bash
   python utils/call_llm.py
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit web interface:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   
   Or generate a complete codebase tutorial directly using the command line:
   ```bash
   python main.py https://github.com/username/repo --include "*.py" "*.js" --exclude "tests/*" --max-size 50000
   ```
   - `repo_url` - URL of the GitHub repository (required)
   - `-n, --name` - Project name (optional, derived from URL if omitted)
   - `-t, --token` - GitHub token (or set GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable)
   - `-o, --output` - Output directory (default: ./output)
   - `-i, --include` - Files to include (e.g., "*.py" "*.js")
   - `-e, --exclude` - Files to exclude (e.g., "tests/*" "docs/*")
   - `-s, --max-size` - Maximum file size in bytes (default: 100KB)
      
The application will crawl the repository, analyze the codebase structure, generate tutorial content, and save the output in the specified directory (default: ./output).


## 💡 Development Tutorial

- I built using [**Agentic Coding**](https://zacharyhuang.substack.com/p/agentic-coding-the-most-fun-way-to), the fastest development paradigm, where humans simply [design](docs/design.md) and agents [code](flow.py).

- The secret weapon is [Pocket Flow](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow), a 100-line LLM framework that lets Agents (e.g., Cursor AI) build for you
