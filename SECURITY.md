# Security Policy

## Privacy and Code Handling

We take code privacy seriously. If our platform processes a user's GitHub repository, we acknowledge the potential exposure of proprietary logic and sensitive implementation details.

To protect user privacy, we strongly recommend and are working toward implementing the following:

- ✅ Provide an option for users to **download** the generated documentation locally.
- ✅ Allow users to **delete their generated documentation** from our servers immediately after download.
- ✅ Implement an **auto-delete policy**, where all uploaded or fetched content is permanently removed after a short period (e.g., 24 hours).
- ✅ Clearly document what data is stored, for how long, and who has access to it.

We are committed to ensuring our platform does not retain user code longer than necessary and never exposes it to the public or unauthorized users.
